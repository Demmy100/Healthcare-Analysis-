# Healthcare Analysis (U.S. Hospitals) 
## Project Overview
As a data analyst at a **national healthcare oversight organization**, I was given access to a dataset of **55,500 unique patient records** from **10 major hospitals across the United States**. This dataset provides a wide-ranging view of:
- Patient demographics (age group, gender, blood type)
- Hospital details and locations
- Medical conditions and diagnoses
- Medications prescribed
- Type of admission (emergency, urgent, planned)
- Treatment costs and insurance providers
- Patient outcomes (e.g., test results)

1. **Patient Demographics**
   - What are the most common **age groups**, **genders**, and **blood types**?
   - Are certain groups being admitted more frequently?

2. **Common Diagnoses**
   - Which **medical conditions** are most commonly diagnosed?
   - Are there demographic patterns for specific conditions?

3. **Length of Stay**
   - How long do patients stay in the hospital for each condition?
   - Does length of stay vary by **hospital** or **admission type**?

4. **Treatment Cost Analysis**
   - What is the **average treatment cost** per condition?
   - Are there significant cost differences between **hospitals** or **insurance providers**?
5. **Hospital Performance**
   - Which hospitals are treating the most patients?
   - How do hospitals compare based on **patient outcomes**?
6. **Medication Trends**
   - Which **medications** are most commonly prescribed per condition?
   - Is medication use consistent across hospitals?
7. **Admission Patterns**
   - Are admissions mostly **emergency**, **urgent**, or **planned**?
   - How does admission type affect cost and stay duration?

8. **Insurance Insights**
   - Which **insurance companies** cover the most patients?
   - Do insurance providers influence **treatment costs** or **outcomes**?

9. **Regional Variations**
   - Where are the hospitals located?
   - Are there regional differences in **health conditions**, **costs**, or **quality of care**?

## Technologies used: SQL and excel for dashboard overview
